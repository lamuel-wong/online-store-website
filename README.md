<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

An online web store inspired by card-style interfaces used by Rothyâ€™s, Amazon, and Airbnb. Implemented to practice building more complex HTML and CSS layouts along with static and dynamic web content.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Crafted an intuitive and engaging interface for a seamless shopping experience.
- **Dynamic Product Catalog:** Implemented a dynamic catalog that updates based on the availability of products (only available products are shown).
- **Visual Product Cards:** Replaced the original HTML table layout with visually appealing product cards. Each card showcases a product's image, name, description, and price in a rectangular layout.
- **Card Design:** Utilized CSS classes and styles to create a visually appealing card design, incorporating rounded corners, subtle shadows, and optimal spacing for an enhanced user experience.
